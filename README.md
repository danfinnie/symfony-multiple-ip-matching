Symfony Multiple IP Matching
============================

This is a test project for a [patch I'm working on](https://github.com/danfinnie/symfony/tree/multiple_ip_matching)
for symfony to accept multiple IP addresses in the security configuration files.  It's gonna be fun for me but other
people shouldn't really have a reason to clone this repo.
